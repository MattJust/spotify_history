# spotify_history

This is a bit of fun using my Spotify library, which you can request through your account, Premium or not.

It shows my top artists, of which many are podcasts, and plays over time. I used Pandas and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebooks.

I'll probably tweak it in the future to add more visualization, if it would be interesting/relevant.
